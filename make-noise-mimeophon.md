One of the funkiest and unmatched delay modules out there. I think the Mimeophon has a permanent place in my rack. Multiple delay modes bring variety, not to mention clocked and unclocked uses bring a beauty all their own. Use short delays with multiplied clocking for thick chorus, divide down for syncopated delay lines, or simply use the module as a filter with a hazy atmosphere. Unpatched and turned up, you can also use the Mimeophon as a VCO.

Character can be dark or bright thanks to built in filtering, Halo also adds an extra dimension and smear to the audio field. Stereo in/out allows for flexibility and fidelity, plus every knob can be modulated, including Mode. Output can also be reversed on the fly, a rare feature in Euro effects.
