A bit of a sleeper on initial release, perhaps because of the teeny but bright bubble display. Clock dividers and clock multipliers had always been important in Eurorack and some great options already existed on the market prior to release, but Pam's Workout allowed users to mix and match trigger across 8 outputs driven by a very stable clock (not to mention it could sync to an external clock as well).

Programming was always a bit tedious with such a limited display. Though "menu diving" was pretty limited, I still remember feeling a lost when using this module. Euclidean mode was the original Pam's killer app. Luckily, ALM / Busy Circuits had other tricks up their sleeve and eventually transformed Pam's Workout into one of the most popular and essential modules on the market.
